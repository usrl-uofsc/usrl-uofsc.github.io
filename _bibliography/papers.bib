	abstract = {Multirotor Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS), widely known as aerial drones, are increasingly used in various indoor and outdoor applications. For outdoor field deployments, the plethora of UAS rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for their localization. However, dense environments and large structures can obscure the signal, resulting in a GNSS-degraded environment. Moreover, outdoor operations depend on weather conditions, and UAS flights are significantly affected by strong winds and possibly stronger wind gusts. This work presents a nonlinear model predictive position controller that uses a disturbance observer to adapt to changing weather conditions and fiducial markers to augment the system’s localization. The developed framework can be easily configured for use in multiple different rigid multirotor platforms. The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown through rigorous experimental work in both the lab and the field. The experimental results demonstrate consistent performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and platform used. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS) have seen unprecedented levels of growth during the last two decades. Although many challenges still exist, one of the main UAS focus research areas is in navigation and control. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of helicopter navigation and control, focusing specifically on small-scale traditional main/tail rotor configuration helicopters. Unique to this paper, is the emphasis placed on navigation/control methods, modeling techniques, loop architectures and structures, and implementations. A ‘reference template’ is presented and used to provide a basis for comparative studies and determine the capabilities and limitations of algorithms for unmanned/autonomous flight, as well as for navigation, and control. A detailed listing of related research is provided, which includes model structure, helicopter platform, control method and loop architecture, flight maneuvers and results for each. The results of this study was driven by and has led to the development of a ‘one-fits-all’ comprehensive and modular navigation controller and timing architecture applicable to any rotorcraft platform. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The rapid assessment of infrastructure following extreme weather or seismic events is important to ensure the stability of structures before their continued use. This work presents an amplitude compensation technique for accurate acceleration measurements formulated for unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) deliverable sensor packages. These packages are designed for measuring the acceleration of structures, for instance, railroad bridges and power transmission towers. Current technology for structural health monitoring is expensive, stationary, and requires maintenance by certified personnel. These attributes prevent rapid assessment of remote and hard-to-reach structures. Low-cost, UAV-delivered sensor packages are an ideal solution due to their ability to be deployed on a large scale in a timely manner; cutting down on cost and the danger affiliated with structural health monitoring following extreme and hazardous events. One challenge to this approach is that the UAV deployable sensor package consists of several systems, including mounting hardware, embedded electronics, and energy storage that result in a loss of transmissibility between the structure and the package's accelerometer. This work proposes a frequency response-based filter to isolate the structure's vibration signature from interference caused by the sensor package itself. Utilizing an input-output relationship between the sensor package and a calibrated reference accelerometer, a model transfer function is constructed. Compensation is performed in the post-processing stage using the inverse transfer function model. This approach is shown to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by 1.2 dB, an increase of 7.17%. This work investigates algorithm robustness and sensitivity to noise across the sensor package's bandwidth of 6-20 Hz. A discussion on the limitations of the system is provided. © 2022 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Robust localization is critical for the navigation and control of mobile robots. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offer different methods for achieving this goal. In some cases however, these methods may not be available or provide high enough accuracy. In such cases, these methods may be augmented or replaced with fiducial marker pose estimation. Fiducial markers can increase the accuracy and robustness of a localization system by providing an easily recognizable feature with embedded fault detection. This paper presents an overview of fiducial markers developed in the recent years and an experimental comparison of the four markers (ARTag, AprilTag, ArUco, and STag) that represent the state-of-the-art and most widely used packages. These markers are evaluated on their accuracy, detection rate and computational cost in several scenarios that include simulated noise from shadows and motion blur. Different marker configurations, including single markers, planar and non-planar bundles and multi-sized marker bundles are also considered in this work. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to investigate the efficacy of Circulation Control (CC) at low Reynolds numbers (Re=150,000) with relatively low blowing rates on a modified NACA0015 wing. Two dual radius ap geometries are developed and tested by varying spe- cific ap parameters from a previously studied baseline configuration. A two-dimensional (2-D) low-speed wind-tunnel experimental study is undertaken to evaluate the effect of trailing edge upper slot blowing at cruise ight, takeoff and landing (0°, 30° and 60° ap deection). The wind tunnel tests are conducted at Mach numbers of 0.03, with moment coefficients of blowing (Cμ) ranging from 0.0 to 0.3. It is found that CC blowing is effective at all cases enabling the wing to achieve high lift-to-drag ratios and high lift augmentation during takeoff and landing. The modified NACA0015 with the smaller Coanda radius ratio (r2=r1) ap is found to be the most efficient at CC blowing achieving a maximum incre- mental lift coeficient (∆ Cl) of 0.89 at 300 ap deection. The lift-to-drag ratio is increased up to 11 times at δ f = 0o ap deection and α = 0o using the same ap configuration. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

While in most applications, the UAS are used for remote\contactless inspections, there are cases where the UAS need to contact the structure and do a measurement or deliver a sensor package. In this paper, we work on the autonomous deployment and retrieval of sensor packages to the underside of structures. The accurate positioning and reliable mounting of the package below a structure is a challenging problem. Based on our prior work in the field, we develop a new control and mission framework that takes into account the estimated contact force to ensure that the package is firmly attached during deployment and securely retrieved when the mission ends. The new system has been thoroughly tested in numerous lab experiments that mimic the conditions of an outdoor setting, and experimental results show that the new approach greatly increases the reliability of the system. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mission planning for small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) as a platform for remote sensors goes beyond the traditional issues of selecting a sensor, flying altitude/speed, spatial resolution, and the date/time of operation. Unlike purchasing or contracting imagery collections from traditional satellite or manned airborne systems, the sUAS operator must carefully select launching, landing, and flight paths that meet both the needs of the remote sensing collection and the regulatory requirements of federal, state, and local regulations. Mission planning for aerial drones must consider temporal and geographic changes in the environment, such as local weather conditions or changing tidal height. One key aspect of aerial drone missions is the visibility of the aircraft and communication with the aircraft. In this research, a visibility model for low-altitude aerial drone operations was designed using a GIS-based framework supported by high spatial resolution LiDAR data. In the example study, the geographic positions of the visibility of an aerial drone used for water sampling at low altitudes (e.g., 2 m above ground level) were modeled at different levels of tidal height. Using geospatial data for a test-case environment at the Winyah Bay estuarine environment in South Carolina, we demonstrate the utility, challenges, and solutions for determining the visibility of a very low-altitude aerial drone used in water sampling. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are vast areas that are constantly changing and evolving. To maintain the ecosystem as well as the structures located close to bodies of water, frequent monitoring is required. Although dangerous and time consuming, manual operations are the conventional way of monitoring such areas. Recently, Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) have been proposed to undertake the monitoring task. As any other platform, ASVs have limitations, such as a restricted point of view and access only where the water is sufficiently deep. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can fly over any terrain and provide a “bird's-eye-view” of the environment. However, UAVs have limited operational time due to power constraints. Heterogeneous marsupial robotic systems use different types of robots to augment their operation envelope, taking advantage of their individual strengths. A marsupial survey system comprised an ASV and a UAV for freshwater monitoring is developed and presented in this paper. This system is able to complete long missions and reach remote locations while also being able to generate detailed maps and inspections of points of interest. The system was thoroughly tested during a 6-month period in a number of field deployments in freshwater ecosystems at Lake Murray and at the Congaree River, SC, USA, to validate its capabilities. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

This landing platform is capable of autonomously self-leveling on rough terrain and inclines up to 25°, and can operate in isolated remote locations for extended periods of time using large onboard lithium batteries and wireless communication. The unique design aspects of this landing platform are that it is mobile, self-leveling, and man-portable. A fully-operational prototype has been designed, constructed and evaluated.

	abstract = {The structural assessment of infrastructure components, such as bridges and railroad tracks, is crucial for their safe operation. The process is expensive and time-consuming given the large amount of structures that require systematic inspection. Over the last decades, non-contact measurement techniques have been developed that allow remote evaluation of a structure that is accurate and not labor intensive. One of the techniques in this field is Digital Image Correlation (DIC), that has proven to be an accurate method to measure 2D and 3D shape and deformation fields in structures. In current applications, DIC makes use of a stationary stereo vision camera system that is rigidly placed close to the inspected object. In this paper, an autonomous system of a drone equipped with a DIC camera system, that successfully performs remote structural evaluation of a railroad tie, is presented. This development significantly increases the portability of DIC, resulting in faster deployment of DIC/Drone measurement systems that can reach remote locations and perform fast and accurate structural health monitoring. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate localization is crucial for the autonomous navigation and control of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In most applications, localization is provided from a Global Navigation Satellite System like GPS and Galileo or more recently from Visual Odometry, Visual-Inertial Odometry, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping methods. In many cases though, especially when precise maneuvers are required, fiducial markers are used. Fiducial markers are able to provide accurate localization data and have been used in many applications where reliable pose measurements are needed for specific objects or locations. This paper presents an experimental comparison of four different open-source fiducial markers that are widely used in UAS applications (ARTag, AprilTag, ArUco, and STag). The fiducial markers are evaluated based on their localization capabilities as well as their computational efficiency. To facilitate the comparison, a ROS package for the STag marker is developed and publicly released. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The availability of historical flood data is vital in recognizing weather-related trends and outlining necessary precautions for at-risk communities. Flood frequency, magnitude, endurance, and volume are traditionally recorded using established streamgages; however, the material and installation costs allow only a few streamgages in a region, which yield a narrow data selection. In particular, stage, the vertical water height in a water body, is an important parameter in determining flood trends. This work investigates a low-cost, compact, rapidly-deployable alternative to traditional stage sensors that will allow for denser sampling within a watershed and a more detailed record of flood events. The package uses a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure stage, onboard memory for recording flood events, and an electropermanet magnet (EPM) to enable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) deployments. Optional modules for solar panels and wireless communication can also be added to extend package longevity or allow wireless control of the EPM. The stage sensor package was found to have a range of 0.02 to 4 m with a 6.9 mm accuracy and capable of a 6.4 day long deployment. With the total cost of production at 271.37 USD, it is a cheaper and more flexible alternative to traditional stage sensors that will enable dense sensor networks and rapid response to flooding events. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Water sensing and sampling is a complex application that can benefit from the use of aerial drones. In the monitoring of an aquatic environment, inspection of its physical, chemical, and biological states are equally important. In most cases, only the physical and chemical properties are investigated due to lack of portable sensor packages capable of in situ measurements of biological indicators. Additionally, biological sample collection for ex situ analysis poses certain challenges which requires specialized sample collection methods. For acquiring a good sample, remote sensing needs to work hand in hand with the sampling mechanism to capture the correct analyte of interest. This work presents the design and development of an aerial drone equipped with a custom-made sensor package and sampling mechanism, for sensing and non-destructive sampling of dissolved organic matter in aquatic environments. The developed system is experimentally validated in an outdoor setting and is shown to be capable for in situ measurements of fluorescent content of water bodies and sensor-triggered sample collection.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is widely used for remote and non-destructive structural health evaluation of infrastructure. Current DIC applications are limited to relatively small areas of structures and require the use of stationary stereo vision camera systems that are not easy to transfer and deploy in remote areas. Objective: The enclosed work describes the development and validation of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS, commonly known as drone) with an onboard stereo-vision system capable of acquiring, storing and transmitting images for analysis to obtain full-field, three-dimensional displacement and strain measurements. Methods: The UAS equipped with a StereoDIC system has been developed and tested in the lab. The drone system, named DroneDIC, autonomously hovers in front of a prestressed railroad tie under pressure and DIC data are collected. A stationary DIC system is used in parallel to collect data for the railroad tie. We compare the data to validate the readings from the DroneDIC system. Results: We present the analysis of the results obtained by both systems. Our study shows that the results we obtain from the DroneDIC system are similar to the ones gathered from the stationary DIC system. Conclusions: This work serves as a proof of concept for the successful integration of DIC and drone technologies into the DroneDIC system. DroneDIC combines the high accuracy inspection capabilities of traditional stationary DIC systems with the mobility offered by drone platforms. This is a major step towards autonomous DIC inspection in portions of a structure where access is difficult via conventional methods. © 2021, Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

	abstract = {Standard quadcopters are popular largely because of their mechanical simplicity relative to other hovering aircraft, low cost and minimum operator involvement. However, this simplicity imposes fundamental limits on the types of maneuvers possible due to its under-actuation. The dexterity and fault tolerance required for flying in limited spaces like forests and industrial infrastructures dictate the use of a bespoke dual-tilting quadcopter that can launch vertically, performs autonomous flight between adjacent obstacles and is even capable of flying in the event of the failure of one or two motors. This paper proposes an actuation concept to enhance the performance characteristics of the conventional under-actuated quadcopter. The practical formation of this concept is followed by the design, modeling, simulation and prototyping of a dual-axis tilting quadcopter. Outdoor flight tests using tilting rotors, to follow a trajectory containing adjacent obstacles, were conducted in order to compare the flight of conventional quadcopter with the proposed over-actuated vehicle. The results show that the quadcopter with tilting rotors provides more agility and mobility to the vehicle especially in narrow indoor and outdoor infrastructures. © 2018 by the authors.},

It has been widely accepted that the orientation and the position of the thumb plays an important role in this characteristic behavior.

Nevertheless, manipulation ability in those hands is to be ameliorated even though they can grasp objects successfully. An appropriate model of the thumb is important to manipulate the objects against the fingers and to maintain the stability. Modeling these complex interactions about the mechanical axes of the joints and how to incorporate these joints in robotic thumbs is a challenging task.

	abstract = {People who use the thumb in repetitive manipulation tasks are likely to develop thumb related impairments from excessive loading at the base joints of the thumb. Biologically informed wearable robotic assistive mechanisms can provide viable solutions to prevent occurring such injuries. This paper tests the hypothesis that an external assistive force at the metacarpophalangeal joint will be most effective when applied perpendicular to the palm folding axis in terms of maximizing the contribution at the thumb-tip as well as minimizing the projections on the vulnerable base joints of the thumb. Experiments conducted using human subjects validated the predictions made by a simplified kinematic model of the thumb that includes a foldable palm, showing that: (1) the palm folding angle varies from 71. 5 ∘ to 75. 3 ∘ (from the radial axis in the coronal plane) for the four thumb-finger pairs and (2) the most effective assistive force direction (from the ulnar axis in the coronal plane) at the MCP joint is in the range 0 ∘< ψ< 30 ∘ for the four thumb-finger pairs. These findings provide design guidelines for hand assistive mechanisms to maximize the efficacy of thumb external assistance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

A low-speed wind-tunnel experimental study is undertaken to evaluate the effect of upper slot blowing along the span over four different Trailing-Edge (TE) Coanda surfaces on three 3-D CCWs for the purpose of lift augmentation. Wind tunnel tests are conducted at Mach numbers of 0:022; 0:024; 0:029 and 0:04, at Reynolds numbers of 0:67 × 105 to 1:26 × 105 with moment coefficients of blowing from 0:0 to 0:011. It is found that the circular Coanda surface configuration (2:1) is the most effective in all three CCWs. At M = 0:022 and α = 18°, the (2:1) Coanda surface on the symmetrical NACA0015 CCW gives the maximum ΔCL = 0:2 at Cμ = 0:011. The maximum lift augmentation ratio of 61 is observed with the (2:1) Coanda surface on the S8036 CCW at α = 2°.},

The development of controllers for unmanned helicopters is a difficult procedure which involves testing through simulation at first, and then actual experimentation on real vehicles. As simulation cannot accurately represent the exact real flight conditions and the dangers involved in them, the suggested test bed fills the gap between simulation runs and experimental flights. The developed system involves a small helicopter mounted on a flying stand, equipped with a set of sensors for real-time flight monitoring and control. For demonstration purposes, the test bed has been used for design and validation of a fuzzy logic based autopilot, able to perform hovering and altitude control.

Three different controllers, H∞, LQR, and PID, are tested against the scaled maneuvers in order to evaluate and compare the performance of each controller. Trajectories are designed according to the proposed scaling laws and they are chosen to be outside and well within the capabilities of the helicopter dynamics to demonstrate the importance of selecting trajectories that both exploit the controller weaknesses while remaining within the flight capabilities of the helicopter. © 2015 IEEE.},

This paper introduces the first navigation framework, called AquaVis, that produces on-line visibility-aware motion plans that enable Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to track multiple visual objectives with an arbitrary camera configuration in real-time. Using the proposed pipeline, AUVs can efficiently move in 3D, reach their goals while avoiding obstacles safely, and maximizing the visibility of multiple objectives along the path within a specified proximity. The method is sufficiently fast to be executed in real-time and is suitable for single or multiple camera configurations. Experimental results show the significant improvement on tracking multiple automatically-extracted points of interest, with low computational overhead and fast re-planning times.Accompanying short video: https://youtu.be/JKO bbrIZyU  © 2021 IEEE.},

The fluorometer uses a 450 nm laser modulated at 10 Hz for excitation and a standard photodiode and transimpedance amplifier for the detection of fluorescence. Additional detectors are available for measuring laser intensity and light scattering. Control of the fluorometer and communication between the fluorometer and the Raspberry Pi 4B computer controlling the sampler were provided by an Arduino microcontroller using the robot operating system (ROS). Calibrations were based on standards of dissolved chlorophyll extracted from Chlorella powder (a widely available dietary supplement). The detection limit for chlorophyll from these calibrations was found to be 0.2 μg per liter of water for a single 0.1 s differential measurement. The detection limit decreases with the square root of the integration time as expected. Detection limits increase by a factor of two to three when mounted in the sUAS due to electrical noise; sUAS acoustic noise and vibration do not appear to contribute significantly. © The Author(s) 2022.},

For the latter, specialized sensors need to be used which in many cases need to be attached to the structure. This work presents a low-cost autonomous UAS for attaching and retrieving sensor packages to the underside of structures for SHM applications. Such a system can be used for nondestructive evaluation of structures by deploying sensors like accelerometers on bridges or tunnels.

This paper proposes a novel kinematic model to analyze the importance of thumb-palm embodiment in grasping objects. The model is validated using human demonstrations for five precision grasp types across five human subjects. The model is used to find whether there are any co-activations among the thumb joint angles and muskuloskeletal parameters of the palm. In this paper we show that there are certain pairs of joints that show stronger linear relationships in the torque space than in joint angle space. These observations provide useful design guidelines to reduce control complexity in anthropomorphic robotic thumbs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {We recently described a lightweight, low-power, waterproof filter fluorometer using a 180° backscatter geometry for chlorophyll-a (chl-a) detection. Before it was constructed it was modeled to ensure it would have satisfactory performance. This manuscript repeats the modeling process that allows the calibration slope and detection limit for a fluorescent analyte in water to be estimated from system component performance and conventional spectrofluorometry alone. These values are validated by comparison to the experimental result of calibration from the completed instrument. Our model yields a calibration slope of 8.22 mV-L/µg for dissolved chl-a, consistent with the experimentally measured slope of 8.21 mV-L/µg. The detection limit modeled from this slope and an estimate of the baseline noise of the instrument was 0.15 µg/L chl-a, while the measured detection limit using real blank samples was 0.18 µg/L, in 0.1 s differential measurements. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) are increasingly used in time-consuming and effort-heavy scientific exploration applications. One such application is the inspection of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of water in aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a novel autonomous UAS capable of sensing water properties and collecting up to three 250 mL water samples from multiple sampling locations. The system features a customized UAS with an in-house built fluorescence sensor and pumping mechanism. The system does in situ fluorescence measurements to map the gradient of fluorescent content across the body of water and determine the best sampling spot for targeted sampling. To ensure safe near-water operation, multiple sensor fusion with an Extended Kalman Filter has been implemented for accurate altitude estimation within 1.5 m from the water surface. To validate the performance of the system, we present experimental results from deployment in two different water ecosystems, namely the Congaree River, SC and Lake Wateree, SC. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The ability to navigate, search, and monitor dynamic marine environments such as ports, deltas, tributaries, and rivers presents several challenges to both human-operated and autonomously operated surface vehicles. Human data collection and monitoring are overly taxing and inconsistent when faced with large coverage areas, disturbed environments, and potentially uninhabitable situations. In contrast, the same missions become achievable with Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) configured and capable of accurately maneuvering in such environments. The two dynamic factors that present formidable challenges to completing precise maneuvers in coastal and moving waters are currents and winds. In this work, we present novel and inexpensive methods for sensing these external forces, together with methods for accurately controlling an ASV in the presence of such external forces. The resulting platform is capable of deploying bathymetric and water quality monitoring sensors. Experimental results in local lakes and rivers demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This 64 MHz controller board provided suitable resolution and speed for analog-to-digital (ADC) conversion, processed data, handled communications via the Robot Operating System (ROS) and included a variety of built-in sensors that were used to monitor the fluorometer for vibration, acoustic noise, water leaks and overheating. The fluorometer was integrated into a small Uncrewed Aircraft System (sUAS) for automated water sampling through a Raspberry Pi master computer using the ROS. The average power consumption was 1.1 W. A signal standard deviation of 334 µV was achieved for the fluorescence blank measurement, mainly determined by the input noise equivalent power of the transimpedance amplifier. An ADC precision of 130 µV for 10 Hz chopped measurements was achieved for signals in the input range 0-600 mV. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Datasets typically used for evaluation include indoor and urban environments, where supporting videos have shown impressive performance. However, such techniques have not been fully evaluated in challenging conditions, such as the marine domain. In this paper, we compare ten recent open-source packages to provide insights on their performance and guidelines on addressing current challenges. Specifically, we selected direct and indirect methods that fuse camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data together. Experiments are conducted by testing all packages on datasets collected over the years with underwater robots in our laboratory. All the datasets are made available online. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is the design, development and evaluation of a light-weight Air Supply Unit (ASU) and its associated speed controller, suitable for use in Circulation Control Wings (CCW) of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). An iterative process, presented here, is used to optimize the design of the centrifugal compressor for the ASU through extensive simulation. The implemented speed controller provides the necessary mass flow rate on-demand by maintaining a fixed velocity ratio (Vjet=V∞) thereby reducing the power penalties associated with operating the ASU continuously. The ASU/controller system is evaluated by integrating with a CCW plenum design capable of distributing air evenly across the span and measuring the Vjet at the slot exit in a laboratory environment. Results obtained demonstrate a close match between experimental tests and simulation in all cases considered. In particular, the velocity at the slot (Vjet) is measured to be 24.5 m/s, which provides sufficient velocity to accomplish Circulation Control during both take off and cruise flight for the purposes of this research. © 2015 IEEE.},
